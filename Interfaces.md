## üìò What is an `Interface`?

Interfaces define contracts that classes must follow ‚Äî especially common in service-oriented and layered architectures.

## Interfaces in C#: A Conceptual Overview

In the C# programming language, **interfaces** define a contract that implementing classes must adhere to. They specify a set of members‚Äîsuch as methods, properties, and events‚Äîthat a class must implement, without providing any implementation logic themselves. Interfaces play a key role in building **loosely coupled systems**, enabling **dependency injection**, and enhancing **testability** within your codebase.

In C#, classes are used to define and instantiate objects. Different kinds of objects are created by defining different classes, each with its own set of properties, methods, and related information. Interfaces, however, differ from classes in several important ways. Rather than describing discrete objects, **interfaces define behavior**. When a class implements an interface, it is essentially stating that *"this class is capable of performing a specific behavior."*

For example, suppose you want different types of objects in your application to have a particular capability‚Äîsuch as the ability to encrypt their data or to broadcast an event when their internal state changes. You could define an interface to represent that capability. Then, any class that needs to offer that behavior would implement the interface accordingly. Other classes in the application can then interact with such objects through the interface, without needing to know the specific type of the underlying class. They only need to know that the object supports the defined interface, and therefore, the specified behavior.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class IDataEncryptable {
        +EncryptData()
    }

    class INotifyOnChange {
        +OnChange()
    }

    class User {
        +EncryptData()
        +OnChange()
    }

    class Document {
        +EncryptData()
    }

    class DataProcessor {
        +ProcessData(IDataEncryptable)
        +Subscribe(INotifyOnChange)
    }

    IDataEncryptable <|.. User
    IDataEncryptable <|.. Document
    INotifyOnChange <|.. User

    DataProcessor --> IDataEncryptable : uses
    DataProcessor --> INotifyOnChange : uses

```



In this sense, an interface acts as a **contract**. When you have a reference to an object that implements a given interface, you are assured that the object provides the functionalities declared by that interface.

## Key Points to Remember About Interfaces in C#

- **Interfaces define behavior, not concrete classes.**
- **A single interface can be implemented by many different classes.**
- **A C# class can inherit from only one base class but may implement multiple interfaces.**
- **Interfaces do not contain implementation logic; they only declare the structure of expected functionality.**
- **The implementing class is responsible for providing the actual behavior.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Example: IRepository Pattern (Generic Repository)

### Interface

```csharp

public interface IRepository<T>
{
    T GetById(int id);
    IEnumerable<T> GetAll();
    void Add(T entity);
    void Delete(int id);
}
```


### Implementation

```csharp

public class SqlRepository<T> : IRepository<T>
{
    public T GetById(int id)
    {
        // Simulated database fetch
        Console.WriteLine($"Fetching {typeof(T).Name} with ID {id}");
        return default!;
    }
    public IEnumerable<T> GetAll()
    {
        return new List<T>(); // Simulated list
    }
    public void Add(T entity)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{typeof(T).Name} added to SQL database");
    }
    public void Delete(int id)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{typeof(T).Name} with ID {id} deleted from SQL");
    }
}
```
‚ú® Usage with Service
```csharp
public class ProductService
{
    private readonly IRepository<Product> _repository;
    public ProductService(IRepository<Product> repository)
    {
        _repository = repository;
    }
    public void AddProduct(Product product)
    {
        _repository.Add(product);
    }
}

```

üìä Class Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram

    class IRepository~T~ {

        +GetById(int id) T

        +GetAll() IEnumerable~T~

        +Add(T entity)

        +Delete(int id)

    }



    class SqlRepository~T~ {

        +GetById(int id) T

        +GetAll() IEnumerable~T~

        +Add(T entity)

        +Delete(int id)

    }



    class ProductService {

        -IRepository<Product> _repository

        +AddProduct(Product product)

    }



    class Product



    IRepository~T~ <|.. SqlRepository~T~

    ProductService --> IRepository~Product~

```


üîî Logging Interface Example

```csharp

public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}
public class FileLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        File.AppendAllText("log.txt", $"{DateTime.Now}: {message}\n");
    }
}

```

### Usage with Dependency Injection

```csharp

public class OrderService
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;
    public OrderService(ILogger logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }
    public void ProcessOrder(int orderId)
    {
        // Order processing logic...
        _logger.Log($"Order {orderId} processed.");
    }
}

```







üìä Diagram for Logger

```mermaid

classDiagram

    class ILogger {

        +Log(string message)

    }



    class FileLogger {

        +Log(string message)

    }



    class OrderService {

        -ILogger _logger

        +ProcessOrder(int orderId)

    }



    ILogger <|.. FileLogger

    OrderService --> ILogger


```
